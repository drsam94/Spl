Spl
===

Shakespeare Compiler written in Python, splc.py
This is a compiler from SPL to C that implements the majority of the Shakespeare programming
language invented by Kalle Hasselstrom and Jon Aslund, I take no credit for inventing the language.
This software is free to edit or use, and though I doubt anyone would use this for many projects,
I guess I would appreciate some degree of acknowledgment if you do.

This compiler implements most features of the Shakespeare Programming language described at
http://shakespearelang.sourceforge.net/report/shakespeare/

The following features have yet to be or may never be implemented:

- Stacks (because who needs data structures in Shakespeare, really?)
- multiple-word nouns in cases where using just the last word would generate any confusion

The following feature not in the original language spec is implemented but is a work in progress:

In the original language spec, goto statements take the form "let us proceed to scene III", "let us return to act I",
etc. As this is both awkward and non-Shakesperian, I have made it so that you can use the name of an act or scene (not case,
punctuation, or whitespace sensitive) in place of a this awkward structure. Therefore, if you had
Act I: The Forest.

Then the sentence "let us return to the forest" is equivalent to "let us return to act I".

This feature, though implemented, is not yet perfect: you can only use it to return to previous acts or scenes 
(or the act/scene you are currently in). Therefore, you cannot use this to jump to scene III from scene II.
Also, like standard gotos, you can not jump to a scene within an act other than the one you are currently in.

I will look into allowing future gotos in this structure, but it works well for past gotos.

The following are planned features not in the original language spec that may be implemented in
later versions of this compiler

- Support for word replaces of functions: If the goal of Shakespeare is to make programs look like plays, then it
  is sub-optimal having to use words like "square root" all over the place, so I may add a way to define equivalent
  words for math functions in a text file.

To use spl, simply run

$ ./spl [Input File]
$ ./a.out

Or, if you would like, you can run

$ python2 splc.py [Input File] > [Output File]
$ gcc [Output File] -lm
$ ./a.out

The spl script should work in any bash terminal, on Windows, the explicit python method should work if you have
all of the right programs installed. I may at some time get around to writing a .bat script for Windows users.

Depenencies:
Python (2.X or 3.X)
gcc
